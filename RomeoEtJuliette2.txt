Juliet :
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo ?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name ;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Romeo :
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this ?
Juliet :
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy ;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague ? it is nor hand nor foot
No arm nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name !
What's in a name ? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet ;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for thy name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.
Romeo :
I take thee at thy word :
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptised ;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
Juliet :
What man art thou, that, thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel ?
Romeo :
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am :
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee ;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
Juliet :
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound :
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague ?
Romeo :
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike
